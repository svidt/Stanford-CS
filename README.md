# Stanford CS193p  
## Developing Mobile Applications for iOS using SwiftUI (2023)

This repository contains my completed assignments and notes from Stanford University's CS193p course: *Developing Applications for iOS using SwiftUI*. The course is taught by Paul Hegarty and covers modern iOS app development using Swift and SwiftUI, with a strong focus on architectural best practices like MVVM, state management, and reactive programming.

## Course Concepts

### What is Swift

Swift is Apple's modern, type-safe, and high-performance programming language designed for building applications across all Apple platforms. It combines the performance of compiled languages with the expressiveness of scripting languages, and supports both object-oriented and functional programming paradigms.

### What is SwiftUI

SwiftUI is a declarative framework introduced by Apple for building user interfaces across iOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS. It allows developers to describe the UI in code using a syntax that reflects the visual structure, and it automatically handles updates to the UI when data changes.

### Object-Oriented vs Functional Programming

The course explores the strengths of both paradigms.  
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** organizes code into objects with properties and behaviors.  
- **Functional Programming** emphasizes immutability, pure functions, and value types. Swift allows for a hybrid approach, using value types like structs for data modeling and declarative syntax for views.

### "Reactive" User Interface Development, Including MVVM

The course emphasizes building UIs that react to state changes automatically.  
- SwiftUI uses **data bindings** and **state-driven views**, reducing boilerplate and increasing maintainability.  
- The **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** architecture separates business logic from UI code, making it easier to manage complexity as apps scale.

### Object-Oriented Databases

Later in the course, we look at how to persist model data using property lists (plist), JSON, and databases like Core Data—Apple's object graph and persistence framework that integrates seamlessly with SwiftUI.

## Running the Projects

Each lecture includes a corresponding Xcode project. To run:

1. Clone the repository: git clone [https://github.com/svidt/stanford-cs.git](https://github.com/svidt/Stanford-CS.git)
2. Open the appropriate `.xcodeproj` or `.xcodeworkspace` file using Xcode.
3. Build and run the app on a simulator or device.
